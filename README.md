# wall-climbing-robot (WCR)
This project is under active development. Current version includes basic hardware setup 
and control logic. Further improvements are planned in adhesion mechanism, stability, and 
ROS2 integration.
## 🚀 Features (Planned & Implemented)
- ✅ Vertical surface climbing (prototype stage)  
- ✅ Embedded motor driver and microcontroller control  
- ⚠️ Adhesion mechanism (under refinement)  
- 🛠️ Wireless/manual control (in progress)  
- 🔮 Future: ROS2 integration for autonomy and navigation
