👉 # 🧗 Wall Climbing Robot (WCR) – Planned Improvements

This document outlines the current status, challenges, and future improvements planned for the Wall Climbing Robot project.  
The project is still **Work in Progress (WIP)**.

---

## ✅ Current Status
- Basic chassis design completed  
- Motor driver and microcontroller integration tested  
- Initial movement achieved on flat surfaces  
- Prototype adhesion mechanism designed but requires refinement  

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues
- Adhesion force is not stable for long-duration climbs  
- Weight distribution affects balance on vertical walls  
- Power consumption is higher than expected during climbing  
- Limited control responsiveness at steep angles  

---

## 🚀 Planned Improvements
### 1. Mechanical
- Improve adhesion mechanism (suction, magnetic, or hybrid)  
- Optimize chassis weight distribution for better balance  
- Reduce vibrations during vertical climbing  

### 2. Electronics & Control
- Upgrade motor drivers for smoother control  
- Implement closed-loop control (PID with sensors)  
- Wireless control module (ESP32 / RF / Bluetooth)  

### 3. Software & Autonomy
- ROS2 integration for higher-level control  
- Simulation setup (Gazebo) for path planning  
- Add sensor fusion (IMU, ultrasonic, LiDAR) for navigation  

### 4. Applications
- Inspection of vertical structures (walls, tanks, bridges)  
- Surveillance in urban environments  
- Disaster rescue in collapsed structures
